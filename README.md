Project Overview
The Titanic Data Analysis Project aims to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the ill-fated ship. The primary goal is to understand the factors that influenced survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This project involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing the data to derive meaningful insights.

Steps to Run the Scripts
Prerequisites:

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Install the necessary libraries, specifically Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. This can be done using the following command:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Dataset Preparation:

Download the Titanic dataset in CSV format and save it as Titanic_data.csv in the same directory as your script. This dataset contains various attributes of the passengers, including their age, fare, class, and survival status.
Loading the Data:

The first step in the script is to load the dataset using the Pandas library. The pd.read_csv() function reads the CSV file and stores the data in a DataFrame, which is then printed to the console for initial inspection.
Handling Missing Values:

The next step involves checking for missing values in the dataset. The script uses the isnull().sum() method to identify columns with missing data.
For the 'Age' column, missing values are filled with the median age of the passengers to maintain the dataset's integrity.
The 'Cabin' column is dropped entirely due to a high proportion of missing values, which could skew the analysis.
Rows with missing values in the 'Embarked' column are removed, as this information is crucial for understanding the embarkation point of the passengers.
Removing Duplicates:

The script then checks for and removes any duplicate rows in the dataset. This step is essential to ensure that each passenger is represented only once, which is critical for accurate analysis.
Data Visualization:

Visualization is a key component of data analysis, as it helps to uncover patterns and insights. The script generates several visualizations:
Boxplot of Fare: This visualization displays the distribution of fare prices among passengers, highlighting any outliers that may exist.
Bar Chart for Survival: This chart illustrates the count of passengers who survived versus those who did not, providing a clear picture of survival rates.
Histogram for Age: This histogram shows the distribution of passenger ages, allowing for an understanding of the age demographics aboard the Titanic.
Correlation Heatmap: This heatmap visualizes the correlation between numeric features in the dataset, helping to identify relationships that may exist between different variables.
Observations
Data Cleaning Importance: The data cleaning process is vital for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. Handling missing values appropriately and removing duplicates helps maintain the dataset's quality.
Insights from Visualizations:
The boxplot of fare prices indicates the presence of outliers, which may warrant further investigation to understand the reasons behind such high fares.
The bar chart reveals that a significant proportion of passengers did not survive, underscoring the tragedy of the Titanic disaster.
The histogram of ages shows a varied distribution, with a notable concentration of younger passengers, which could suggest demographic trends among those who traveled on the Titanic.
The correlation heatmap provides insights into the relationships between numeric features, guiding further analysis or potential predictive modeling efforts.
By following these theoretical steps, one can effectively run the Titanic data analysis project and gain valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This project serves as an excellent introduction to data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization techniques in Python.
